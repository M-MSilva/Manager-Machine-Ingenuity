## About this Project

Administer and manage the production of a work or equipment.

## Applications

This project can be used to support your next construction construction or equipment. Although this program is part of my personal portfolio, feel free to use it in studies, repairs and improvements. :call_me_hand:

**PS**: As one of the purposes of this program is learning C++ language, the code is not so robust to manage the creation of equipment/work, but in the future it will be improved.

## Functionalities

* Enter the details of the responsible engineer/technician;
* Do the same for the contractor;
* Specify type of application required, if it will be the construction of a work or equipment.

If you want to engage to building an ingenuity:

  * Indicate the name of the work, its description, amount of material used;
  * Find out the final price of the project;
  * Manage your construction.
  
Case you want to build new equipment:
  
  * Enter the equipment name;
  * Specify the number of employees needed for the operation;
  * Point how the material will be produced, its quantity and quality.

If you want to create a work and equipment, you will also know the final price of this one.

## Motivation

This project was developed while I was in graduation and learning c++, in its construction I tried to insert all the concepts used in the language, such as classes, objects, attributes, encapsulation, inheritance, among others. Therefore, this project served for learning and for future applications. :relaxed:

## Remarks about the program

The program works fine, if the employer and engineer information is entered first, possible errors should otherwise occur due to dependencies that can be observed in the code.

## Instructions for compiling and executing the code

### Initial requirements

To compile the code it is necessary to have any compiler that runs programs in c++ (compilers list), besides this list there are online compilers that easily implement the code such as https://www.onlinegdb.com/ and https://replit.com.

**PS**: For the code to be executed it is necessary that all the files are in the same folder.
